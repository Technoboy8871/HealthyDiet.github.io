        <p style="color: red;">People often think of “a diet” as a specific weight loss plan, but diet simply refers to the types and amounts of food a person eats.A healthful diet must include a balance of several food groups, as no single group can provide everything the body needs for good health.Making healthful food choices reduces a person’s risk of many chronic health conditions, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and cancer.There is a wealth of information available, so designing a suitable, healthful diet can feel overwhelming. That said, a few simple changes can make a diet more nutritious and reduce the risk of many medical problems.</p>
